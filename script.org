* Actor Model and process
1. Each actor is a process.
2. Each process performs a specific task.
3. To tell a process to do something, you need to send it a
   message. The process can also reply by sending back another
   message.
4. Messages are pattern matched
5. Other than that, processes do not share any information with other
   processes.
